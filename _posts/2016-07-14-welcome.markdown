This is it, the very first post on my blog. I was wondering for some time whether I should start a blog and risk not updating it or rather just be more active on social media. Well apparently I did go for trying how I'll be doing with having a blog. I feel like it's a better, more personal place for me to put things out. Furthermore I like to stay independent from (social media) plattforms and going on old-school-ish way here. Ultimately I can still post links to my blog anywhere, if I feel like really having to reach out. 

That said there will be no focused objective of this blog. It's rather an online place for me to share ideas or funny stuff I come accross. Therefor the posting will be pretty random in both timing and content.

Cheers Martin
