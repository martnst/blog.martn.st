Did you ever found an intressting talk of somebody on youtube which seems to long to watch it right away? Or rather listen to it as the video only shows the speaker. Well you can simply add to your *watch later* list. Oh this other videos also look interesting - *Let's subscribe to the channel!*

As a regular [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) listener, here is a better idea: 

1. Click on the youtube video's channel
2. Copy the channel url
3. Head over to [podsync.net](http://podsync.net/) and turn it into a podcast feed
4. Subscribe to the feed on your favorite podcast client app

Now you can enjoy not just the one talk but also more of the channel on the go. ðŸ™‚
