  <h2>I like to divide my work into three scopes</h2>
  <p>Focus is always changing back and forth from time to time.</p>

          <h3>Freelancing</h3>
          <p>As a freelancer I focus on native iOS development, however I am also open to new opportunities. Check out my <a href="/skills-and-tools" class="inline">skills and tools</a> I am familiar with as well as the <a href="http://madeby.martn.st/#client-apps" class="inline">apps &amp; projects</a> I have been part of the team. </p>
          <p><a href="mailto:martin@martn.st" class="inline">Get in touch</a> if you are looking for developers for your next awesome project.

          <h3>Indi-Development</h3>
          <p>I have always enjoyed building things. By learning how to write software and build apps in particular I have opened up a whole new world for that.</p>
          <p>For <a href="http://madeby.martn.st/" class="inline">my own projects</a> I mostly look for ideas that can be build rather easily by still creating something useful (and eventually even valuable). Furthermore the projects have to be maintainable as a side project on my own.</p>
          <p>However, I am also open to join or contribute to (open source) projects if they are appealing to me. That being said, feel free to <a href="mailto:hi@martn.st" class="inline">get in touch</a> about any projects.</p>

          <h3>Start-Up: <a href="https://www.internationalshowtimes.com" target="_blank">iShowtimes</a></h3>
          <p>One easy API for worldwide movie showtime listings, ticketing links and movie meta data.</p>          
          <p>Coming from a failed B2C case of building <a href="http://www.cinepass.de/" class="inline" target="_blank">a unified plattform for selling cinema online tickets in Germany</a>, we have changed our mission to provide the greatest API and data for showtimes not just in Germany but globally.</p>
          <p>If you were to put any of the typical start-up roles on me, I would consider myself to be the <i>hands-on CTO</i> in the five heads team.</p>
