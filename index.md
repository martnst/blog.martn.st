          <h3>Freelancing</h3>
          <p>As a freelancer I focus on iOS development, but I am also open to new opportunities. <a href="http://madeby.martn.st/#client-apps" class="inline">Check out</a> the apps I have been part of the team. Or <a href="#contact" class="inline">get in touch</a> if you are looking for developers for your next awesome project.</p>

          <h3>Indi-Development</h3>
          <p>I have always enjoyed building things. By learning how to write software and build apps in particular I have opened up a whole new world for that.</p>
          <p>For <a href="http://madeby.martn.st/" class="inline">my own projects</a> I mostly look for ideas that can be build rather easily by still creating something useful (and eventually even valuable). Furthermore the projects have to be maintainable as a side project on my own.</p>
          <p>However, I am also open to join or contribute to (open source) projects if they are appealing to me. That being said, feel free to <a href="#contact" class="inline">get in touch</a> about any projects.</p>

          <p>CINEPASS is the easiest way to get your movie tickets in Germany.</p>
          <p>Enjoying building things also lead me to start an own business.
