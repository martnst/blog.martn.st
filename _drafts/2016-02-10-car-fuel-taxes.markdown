I've been living in the city of Berlin for years and never had an issue with all the cars - until some time ago. First I noticed how silly it is to have all these parking cars taking up all the space. Therefor I was really excited when car sharing by the larger companies (like [DriveNow](https://drive-now.com), [Car2go](https://car2go.com/) or [multicity](https://www.multicity-carsharing.de/)[^1]) and startups like [Drivy](https://www.drivy.com) came up with potential solutions that could make a change. 

However, here now in 2016, it did't change in a noticeable way. Instead I started to be bothered by the smell of exhaust gases when a car drives close by. Living the country with such a tradition car manufacturers and engineering, I started to wonder why we have so little (like close to zero) electrical cars in it's capital yet. While [Volkswagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal) is struggling with getting the diesel motor cleanish there is no serious effort of electrical car manufacturing in Germany (compared to [Tesla](https://www.teslamotors.com)). 




##### Concept 

- increase taxes on fuel on all gas stations within the green traffic zone of any city by x % 
	- controlled by state (nation)

	- takes by the nation should be used to support the development of electrical cars such as: 
		- aid payments for people buying electrical cars over combustion engine
		- aid payments for car manufactures 
		- support research of related technology 
		
		
	
- optionally increase taxes on fuel on all gas stations the entire city by y%
	- controlled by the city 
	- percentage y adds to the nation percentage x, so adding taxes by the city will increase fuel prices in the green traffic zones even more 
	

	- taxes by the city should be used to drive changes that makes it more appealing to not go by combustion engine driven cars or even not by car at all, examples:
		- install more charging stations for electrical cars
		- improve bike lanes
		- invest in public transport
